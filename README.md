This project details the design and implementation of a generative system for music audio signals leveraging the Birdie framework, a SSM designed for flexible training objective management. The core technical contribution involves bridging the modality gap between continuous audio signals and discrete token sequences suitable for transformer-based language models. We developed a multi-stage pipeline encompassing audio preprocessing, mel-spectrogram conversion, vector quantization (VQ) via k-means clustering to create an audio codebook, and a specialized tokenizer for bidirectional conversion. This tokenized representation interfaces with a standard transformer architecture trained using Birdie's objective system, primarily focusing on Prefix Language Modeling (PLM). We analyze the technical challenges encountered, particularly concerning the audio-to-token conversion process, integration with Birdie's data handling expectations, and memory management constraints within multi-process environments, especially on Windows platforms. The resulting system demonstrates the feasibility of applying text-centric training frameworks like Birdie to the audio domain, generating audio, yet more efforts are required to obtain competitive results.
